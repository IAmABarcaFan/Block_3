To Do List:
1. To solve 3, we could put in a check for the last argument in nested_arguments, if it is --save_plot ...
   (Doing this allows for the removal of the variable list_flag_copy, and merges the two if-elif structure)

2. Code the functions that do the numberical processing, plotting and other stuff 
   (Remeber modularisation, don't stuff all code into main())

3. (Line 79, main()) Currently the flag system only works if --save_plot is the last flag given. 
   (If there is a flow system to allow for non-indexing input, that would be great)
